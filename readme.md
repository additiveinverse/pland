# Proemland for the 2016

the old is new again.

Gonna try spooling this whole thing outside of textpattern for a change.

* angular for the discog / product loops
* static rendered front end via jade
* less for the preprocessor
* plus a bunch of other angular bits and bobs
* static json ( this is a baby step to have the data served from mongo )

good times.
