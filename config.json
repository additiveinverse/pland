			"content": "Proem (otherwise known as Richard Bailey) has been releasing emotive, ham-fisted electronic music since the release of Burnplate no.1 on the now defunct Hydrant records. Since then, he as released several full lengths, ep's and made remix and various artist appearances for underground electronic labels such as merck, n5md, hymen, and toytronic. Richard began experimenting, armed with thrift store record players, some tape (for locked grooves), tape decks and a handful of effects (reverb, obviously). The early recordings focused largely on drone, noise and sound collage and elements of these experiments set in motion the murky and tonal underpinnings of his later work. These same underpinnings would not return full focus until the release of the darkerstill ep on enpeg",
