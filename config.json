				"content": "I am going to do something completely mental and toss these up on bandcamp and spotify at the same time... There are probably only 3 people in the world that will think they are worth having.<br/><br/>Vault 2-4 is mostly things I honestly don't remember making during the course of making 'you shall have ever been' onward. One of them is just the send channels of a song from the next proem record. I'll let you guess which.<br/><br/>Vault 1-4 is where it gets weird and tricky. This collection reaches as far back as 94. I need to warn you though, this material is LOUD. I hinted at releasing some of my harsh noise material someday and here it is. It's all sound and fury and weirdly about compositional 'events'. I think it's still remotely interesting to listen to. Few will likely agree.",

			"content": "Richard Bailey has been releasing emotive, ham-fisted electronic music under the pseudonym of \"Proem\" since the release of Burnplate no.1 on Hydrant records in 1999. For the last fifteen odd years, he as released a sizable collection of full lengths, ep's, and various artist appearances for underground electronic labels such as n5md, merck, hymen, and toytronic.<br/><br/>Inspired by dramatic lighting and insomnia, our hero began his journey armed with thrift store record players, some tape (for locked grooves), tape decks, casio sk-5's and a handful of effects. The early recordings focused largely on locked groove drones, harsh noise, mangling and making sound by any means necessary. These experiments, while more textural than tonal, set in motion the murky underpinnings of his later work.<br/><br/>Once Richard discovered that the family computer, with the aid of a DOS based tracker (modedit) and his 16bit sound card, could remove most of the hardware and timing limitations he quickly changed directions and dove head first into computer based music. He looked up from the screen a year later with a demo he sent out to labels that would welcome his brand of distorted beats and somber melodies. A few false starts and a pile of silent rejections later, the nice folks at Hydrant agreed to release a 1000 copy run and then promo the hell out of it at the winter music conference that year. A few other fledgling labels took notice and before long, Proem had a regular release schedule on several different labels.",
